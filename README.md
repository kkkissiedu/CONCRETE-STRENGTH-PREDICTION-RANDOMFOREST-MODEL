# 🧪 Data-Driven Concrete Strength Prediction

This project applies **machine learning** to a core civil engineering challenge: predicting the **compressive strength** of concrete. Using a **Random Forest Regressor**, it estimates strength based on the mix components—enabling optimization for **performance**, **cost**, and **sustainability**.

> ✅ Successfully used on *"The Ark"* construction project to select a mix with **10% higher predicted strength**.

## 🎯 Goal & Motivation

Traditional mix design methods are empirical and slow. This project provides a **data-driven alternative** to:

- ⚡ Rapidly estimate strength from mix proportions  
- 🧠 Optimize mix designs more efficiently  
- 🏗️ Support faster, smarter material decisions
